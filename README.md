# Chatbot
## What is Chatbot?
A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. 
Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. 
There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built; Retrieval based and Generative based models.

## The Dataset
The dataset we will be using is ‘intents.json’. 
This is a JSON file that contains the patterns we need to find and the responses we want to return to the user.

### Here are the 5 steps to create a chatbot in Python from scratch:
## 1.	Import and load the data file
## 2.	Preprocess data
## 3.	Create training and testing data
## 4.	Build the model
## 5.	Predict the response

## Summary
In this project, we understood about chatbots and implemented a deep learning version of a chatbot in Python which is accurate. 
You can customize the data according to business requirements and train the chatbot with great accuracy. 
Chatbots are used everywhere and all businesses is looking forward to implementing bot in their workflow.
